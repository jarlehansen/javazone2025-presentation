# JavaZone 2025 MCP Presentation

This project contains a presentation about MCP (Model Context Protocol) for JavaZone 2025.

The presentation is built using [Marp](https://marp.app/), a markdown presentation ecosystem that converts markdown files into beautiful slide decks.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm start

- `presentation.html` - Generated HTML presentation file
- `package.json` - Project configuration and dependencies
